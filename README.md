## [nil-ril-nf Documentation](http://andersenlab.org/dry-guide/pipeline-nil-ril/)

# nil-ril-nf

The `nil-ril-nf` pipeline will align, call variants, and generate datasets for NIL and RIL sequence data. It runs a hidden-markov-model to fill in missing genotypes from low-coverage sequence data.

[TOC]

# Docker image

The docker image used by the `nil-ril-nf` pipeline is the `nil-ril-nf` docker image:

#### [andersenlab/nil-ril-nf](https://hub.docker.com/r/andersenlab/nil-ril-nf/)

The __Dockerfile__ is stored in the root of the `nil-nf` github repo and is automatically built on [Dockerhub](http://www.dockerhub.com) whenever the repo is pushed.

# Parameters

## --debug

The pipeline comes pre-packed with fastq's and a VCF that can be used to debug. You can use the following command to debug:

```
nextflow run main.nf --debug --reference=<path to reference>
```

## --cores

The number of cores to use during alignments and variant calling.

## --A, --B

Two parental strains must be provided. By default these are N2 and CB4856. The parental strains provided __must__ be present in the VCF provided. Their genotypes are pulled from that VCF and used to generate the HMM. See below for more details.

## --cA, --cB

The color to use for parental strain A and B on plots.

## --out

A directory in which to output results. By default it will be `NIL-A-B-YYYY-MM-DD` where A and be are the parental strains.

## --fqs (FASTQs)

In order to process NIL data, you need to move the sequence data to a folder and create a `fq_sheet.tsv`. This file defines the fastqs that should be processed. The fastq files are *relative* to that file. The fastq sheet details the FASTQ files and their associated strains. It should be tab-delimited and look like this:

```
NIL_01   NIL_01_ID    S16 NIL_01_1.fq.gz   NIL_01_2.fq.gz
NIL_02   NIL_02_ID    S1  NIL_02_1.fq.gz   NIL_02_2.fq.gz
```

Notice that the file does not include a header. The table with corresponding columns looks like this.

| strain   | fastq_pair_id   | library   | fastq-1-path   | fastq-2-path   |
|:-------|:-----------------------|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NIL_01 | NIL_01_ID | S16 | NIL_01_1.fq.gz | NIL_01_2.fq.gz |
| NIL_02 | NIL_02_ID | S1  | NIL_02_1.fq.gz | NIL_02_2.fq.gz |

The columns are detailed below:

* __strain__ - The name of the strain. If a strain was sequenced multiple times this file is used to identify that fact and merge those fastq-pairs together following alignment.
* __fastq_pair_id__ - This must be unique identifier for all individual FASTQ pairs.
* __library__ - A string identifying the DNA library. If you sequenced a strain from different library preps it can be beneficial when calling variants. The string can be arbitrary (e.g. LIB1) as well if only one library prep was used.
* __fastq-1-path__ - The __relative__ path of the first fastq.
* __fastq-2-path__ - The __relative__ path of the second fastq.

This file needs to be placed along with the sequence data into a folder. The tree will look like this:

```
NIL_SEQ_DATA/
├── NIL_01_1.fq.gz
├── NIL_01_2.fq.gz
├── NIL_02_1.fq.gz
├── NIL_02_2.fq.gz
└── fq_sheet.tsv
```

Set `--fqs` as `--fqs=/the/path/to/fq_sheet.tsv`.

!!! Important
    Do not perform any pre-processing on NIL data. NIL-data is low-coverage by design and you want to retain as much sequence data (however poor) as possible.

## --vcf (Parental VCF)

Before you begin, you will need access to a VCF with high-coverage data from the parental strains. In general, this can be obtained using the latest release of the wild-isolate data which is usually located in the b1059 analysis folder. For example, you would likely want to use:

`/projects/b1059/analysis/WI-20170531/vcf/WI.20170531.hard-filter.vcf.gz`

This is the __hard-filtered__ VCF, meaning that poor quality variants have been stripped. Use hard-filtered VCFs for this pipeline.

Set the parental VCF as `--vcf=/the/path/to/WI.20170531.hard-filter.vcf.gz`

## --reference

A fasta reference indexed with BWA. On Quest, the reference is available here:

```
/projects/b1059/data/genomes/c_elegans/WS245/WS245.fa.gz
```

## --tmpdir

A directory for storing temporary data.

# Output

The final output directory looks like this:

```

### log.txt

A summary of the nextflow run.

### duplicates/

__bam_duplicates.tsv__ - A summary of duplicate reads from aligned bams.

### fq/

* __fq_bam_idxstats.tsv__ - A summary of mapped and unmapped reads by fastq pair.
* __fq_bam_stats.tsv__ - BAM summary by fastq pair.
* __fq_coverage.full.tsv__ - Coverage summary by chromosome
* __fq_coverage.tsv__ - Simple coverage file by fastq

### SM/

If you have multiple fastq pairs per sample, their alignments will be combined into a strain or sample-level BAM and the results will be output to this directory.

* __SM_bam_idxstats.tsv__ - A summary of mapped and unmapped reads by sample.
* __SM_bam_stats.tsv__ - BAM summary at the sample level
* __SM_coverage.full.tsv__ - Coverage at the sample level
* __SM_coverage.tsv__ - Simple coverage at the sample level.

### hmm/

* __gt_hmm.(png/svg)__ - Haplotype plot for NILs.
* __gt_hmm.tsv__ - Long form genotypes file.

### plots/

* __coverage_comparison.(png/svg/pdf)__ - Compares FASTQ and Sample-level coverage. Note that coverage is not simply cumulative. Only uniquely mapped reads count towards coverage, so it is possible that the sample-level coverage will not equal to the cumulative sum of the coverages of individual FASTQ pairs.
* __duplicates.(png/svg/pdf)__ - Coverage vs. percent duplicated.
* __unmapped_reads.(png/svg/pdf)__ - Coverage vs. unmapped read percent.

### sitelist/

* `<A>.<B>.sitelist.tsv.gz[+.tbi]` - A tabix-indexed list of sites found to be different between both parental strains.

### vcf/

!!! Important
    __gt_hmm_fill.tsv__ is for visualization purposes only. To determine breakpoints you should use __gt_hmm.tsv__.

* __gt_hmm.tsv__ - Haplotypes defined by region with associated information.
* __gt_hmm_fill.tsv__ - Same as above, but using `--infill` and `--endfill` with VCF-Kit. For more information, see [VCF-Kit Documentation](http://vcf-kit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* __NIL.filtered.vcf.gz__ - A VCF genotypes including the NILs and parental genotypes.
* __NIL.filtered.stats.txt__ - Summary of filtered genotypes. Generated by `bcftools stats NIL.filtered.vcf.gz`
* __NIL.hmm.vcf.gz__ - The RIL VCF as output by VCF-Kit; HMM applied to determine genotypes.
* __union_vcfs.txt__ - A list of VCFs that were merged to generate RIL.filter.vcf.gz
